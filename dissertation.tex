\section{Introduction}
% The very first letter is a 2 line initial drop letter followed
% by the rest of the first word in caps.
% 
% form to use if the first word consists of a single letter:
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{demo} file is ....
% 
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by
% normal text (unknown if ever used by the IEEE):
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{}demo file is ....
% 
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:
% \IEEEPARstart{T}{his demo} file is ....
% 
% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.
\IEEEPARstart{T}{his} demo file is intended to serve as a ``starter file''
for your final year project dissertation.

which you will then expand into your dissertation in COMP360.

\subsection{Visualising Data}
Visualising data/trees in general
......

Displaying data to player:

Visualising AI /pathfinding in games games: 

Haworth \textit{et al} looked at visualising decision trees in games to see what effect it had on children's analytical reasoning and game play \cite{Haworth2010}.

While they did not come any definite conclusions their results suggested that data aided players in playing the game. However an issue they noted was that the game could be unbalanced at the end making the usefulness of the tree being displayed questionable.  

Haworth \textit{et al} only made a simple game that was tested on children. In contrast Isla visualed pathfinding in a game that is now for sale?? (Word it better) \cite{Isla2014}. Isla's game Third Eye Crime displayed Occupancy maps to the player. This was designed to make the player want trigger the mechanic ...
 


\subsection{Pathfinding}
Third Eye Crime \cite{Isla2014} visualises enemy pathfinding as the main mechanic. Isla uses occupancy maps ....
