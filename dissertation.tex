The research questions proposed in this project are: how does visualising RRT path finding in a Non Player Character (NPC) effect the perceived intelligence of the NPC in digital games? and how does visualising RRT path finding in a Non Player Character (NPC) effect the way partcipants navigate a level of game? 

The project will look at different methods of visualising RRT path finding to investigate what effects that can have on how the partcipants plays the game and explores the level.  Previous papers have researched visualising Artifical Intelligence (AI) and foregrounding AI but not at what effect this has on how the partcipants play the game.


\subsection{Hypothesis:}
Null: Visualising RRT has no effect on how the partcipant plays a level of game. \\
Hypothesis: Visualising RRT has a significant effect on how the partcipant plays a level of game. 


\section{Literature Review}
\subsection{Visualising Data and AI}
While AI is frequently used in digital games it is not often visualised or foregrounded. However, Treanor \textit{et al} say that the AI is often designed to fit the game and is therefore rudimentary??? \cite{treanor2015}.
They surveyed many games that foreground AI in different ways and proposed design patterns for different methods of foregrounding AI. The two design patterns of interest for this project are AI as a Villian and AI is Visualised. The design pattern "AI as Villian" is where the enemy's AI is trying to create an experience instead or out right defeating the player. The example they gave as an example of this pattern was Alien Isloation where the player is hunted by an NPC.  This related the this paper as the visualising of RRT is not to find a way to find the player but to give the player a way to predict or interpret what the Ai is doing and therfore overcome it.
Another design pattern of interest is "AI is Visualised". This pattern involves visualising the AI's state and decision making. This is normally hidden from the player but this design pattern looks at making a mechanic from visualising it. The example given by Treanor \textit{et al} is Third Eye Crime.  Third Eye Crime is a game that followed the "AI is Visualised" design pattern \cite{Isla2014}.  Third Eye Crime displayed the enemy's path finding to the player using Occupancy maps.  
This was designed to make the player want trigger the mechanic ...  Again this paper will also use this design pattern by visualising the NPC's pathfinding.  The RRT pathfinding will be visualised in different ways.


While Haworth \textit{et al} do not visualise an AI process they do visualise the possible decsision in a game on a tree structure \cite{Haworth2010}. They research visualising decision trees in a game to see what effect it had on children's analytical reasoning and game play.  While they did not come to any definite conclusions their results suggested that data aided players in playing the game as in later level the children struggled to beat the game without the visualised tree. However, an issue they noted was that the game could be unbalanced at the end making the usefulness of the tree being questionable.  

A further issue is that Haworth \textit{et al} only tested the tree in a relatively simple 2D game that was tested on children. This does not give any data on 3D games on the market??? In contrast, Isla's visualised pathfinding in Third Eye Crime is on sale?? (Word it better) \cite{Isla2014}.
 
Like  Haworth \textit{et al}, Bauer \textit{et al} also research visualising tree structures \cite{bauer2012}. However, they did use an AI technique, they used Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees (RRT). They used RRT in level design tools to predict possible moves the player could make.  They then used a clustering algorithm to organise the tree to make it legiable?

\subsection{Pathfinding}
In digital games the A* path finding algorithm appears to be the most widely used \cite{Algfoor2015}.  Algfoor \textit{et al} surveyed numerous papers on path finding. The focus appeared to be on the type of grids used in pathfindign and then numerous algorithms that can be used \cite{Algfoor2015}. The most popular being the A* algorithm for use in digital games and robotics. RRT pathfindgin was nto mentioned. 
They surveryed many grid types and gave the advantages of each. However, RRT does not use grids it instead uses nodes makeing the grid type irrelevant.\\

Third Eye Crime was previously mentioned for it's use of design patterns. However it also uses pathfinding as an improtant mechanic \cite{Isla2014}. Isla uses occupancy map for pathfinding. Occupancy or Influence maps do not produce an exact path instead they show the probability of the player being in different parts of the map \cite{Isla2014, Miles2006}. Isla used Occupancy maps to show where the enemy AI thinks the player currently is. Miles and Loius used influcnece maps but used it to inform A* pathfinding instead of use the map itelf for pathfinding \cite{Miles2006}.\\
 
A further paper on path finding is Wang and Lu's paper which looksg at path finding in a 3D environment. While again they were using A* they look at using A* in 3D and suggest using nodes instead of a grid?? \cite{wang2012}.

Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees(RRT) are a search method used more widely in robotics than digital games\cite{Kuffner2000}. Kuffner and LaValle first proposed RRT in 2000, they intended to produce a random algorithm more efficent than the other search algorithms avaliable at the time. RRT Path Planner is a variant of RRT proposed by Kuffner and LaValle that can be used to find paths from the generated tree \cite{Kuffner2000}.



\section{Methodology}
The methodology that will be used to seek the answers to the proposed questions will be play testing and questionnaires. This will require human partcipants to play the game and fill in the questionnaires. 

\subsection{Playtest Variations}
There will be mulitple variations of the game. The first will have no visualiation the NPC will use pathfinding to patrol the level but the will be no visualisation to indicate what it is doing.  The second variation will have a visualisation of the RRT pathfinding in front of it. While the RRT will be used to pathfind in a large area on a small area will be visualised in an attempt to not confuse the partcipants. The third variation will also have visualised RRt pathfinding but instead of a visual tree it will be environmental queues that give the partcipants clues to where the NPC may go. A-B testing will used on partcipants. Partcipants will be assigned different version of the game to play and then the results will be compared. \\
\\
While the participant is playing the game will export their current location to a CSV file every second for use in R. A heat map can then be generated from this data to see if there are any significant patterns. A heat map will be used as they are easy to generate and easy to discern patterns from \cite{Wallner2015}

There will also be a questionnaire for the participants to fill out after completing the play test.

\subsection{Questionnaire}
The questionnaire will be completed using an online questionnaire such as Google Forms. The parcipants will have to answers questions using Likert scales.
